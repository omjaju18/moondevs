# Task-Fragmentation
AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

My Pick - Fragmentation of UI

## My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that

I'm choosing UI fragmentation over hooks because it offers a clearer way to organize and reuse different parts of the user interface. By breaking the UI into smaller, independent components, it becomes easier to manage and modify them without affecting the rest of the application.To be honest done some changes in fragmentation of functionality as well.
